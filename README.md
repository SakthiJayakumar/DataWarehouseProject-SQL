In a data warehouse or lakehouse architecture, the **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers** represent a progressive refinement of data quality and usabilityâ€”often referred to as the **Medallion Architecture**. Here's how each layer works:

---

### ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Layer â€“ *Raw Ingestion*
- **Purpose**: Store raw, unprocessed data exactly as received from source systems (e.g., APIs, logs, IoT, databases).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Schema-on-read
  - High volume, low structure
  - Includes metadata like load timestamps
- **Use Cases**: Archiving, reprocessing, data lineage, and auditability

---

### ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Layer â€“ *Cleansed & Conformed*
- **Purpose**: Clean, validate, and standardize data from the Bronze layer.
- **Transformations**:
  - Deduplication
  - Null handling and type casting
  - Joining datasets (e.g., customer + transactions)
- **Use Cases**: Intermediate analytics, self-service BI, and feeding ML models

---

### ðŸ¥‡ Gold Layer â€“ *Curated & Aggregated*
- **Purpose**: Provide business-ready, aggregated data for reporting and decision-making.
- **Features**:
  - Pre-aggregated KPIs (e.g., monthly revenue, churn rate)
  - Dimensional modeling (star/snowflake schema)
  - Optimized for dashboards and executive insights
- **Use Cases**: BI dashboards, executive reporting, predictive analytics
